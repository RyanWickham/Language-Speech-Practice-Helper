# Language-Speech-Pronunciation-Practice-Helper

## About

A test application to help practice speaking pronunciation skills for a foreign language.

This application is to let the user choose a language, then the user is to write down a word/words/sentence into the text box.
The user is then to press the record button and speek the word/words there were typed.
The application should then display the spoken words on the screen, displaying what was correct and what was wrong with the users pronunciation.

- [x] The confidence of the system in displaying what was said (as a %).
- [ ] List of things the system things the user might of said, but was not sure of (with confidence).
